# NGN3

This is a projecct analysing the target/off-target effects in porcine blastocysts and partenotes microinjected/electroporated with CRISPr/Cas9 with a guideRNA targeting the gene neurogulin (NGN3)

## Data 

74 samples diivided in 3 groups (BL - blastocysts, BLM - blatocysts mosaic, PTM - partenotes mosaic) including two controls not injected. The target region will be analysed in all samples and the off target only in the BL group. The sequences were obtained through PacBio technology and  the results will be compared to the sanger sequence of the same samples (BLM, PTM),
