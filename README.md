## Project Summary

In this project we use the CRISPR/Cas9 system targeting the porcine neurogenin-3 gene in blastocysts and partenotes to analyze the mutation and cleavage efficiency at the target region, as well as the identification of multiple variant formation through high-throughput long read amplicon sequencing in PACBIO technology. (ask Insung which one). This project will also analyze seven off-target sites using the PACBIO technology in long (more than 1 kb) amplicons. Sanger sequencing was also run on the samples and the results were compared to the high-throughput data. 
Sanger sequence data were processed at the (UC Davis sequencing facility?) and analyzed using SnapGene and CRISPRID, while PACBIO was 



## Data 

74 samples divided in 3 groups (BL - blastocysts, BLM - blatocysts mosaic, PTM - partenotes mosaic) including two controls not injected. The target region will be analysed in all samples and the off target only in the BL group. The sequences were obtained through PacBio technology and  the results will be compared to the sanger sequence of the same samples (BLM, PTM),
